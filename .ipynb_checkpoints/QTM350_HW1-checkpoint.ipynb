Essentially, the *diff* command, which stands for difference, is used to show the differences that exist in files when they are compared line by line. It lets us know which lines would have to be changed in a file in order to make both files identical to each other. This command uses special symbols and instruction in order to let the user know which exact changes to make to ensure that the files are identical to each other.\n",

Often in psychology research, large cross-sectional studies or longitudinal ones are utilized and there are many subjects and variables to consider. If we wanted to quickly compare in a quantitative sense the basic differences among subjects in a study, the *diff* command would be extremely useful. A specific of this would be psychology research that I have previously worked on in the past which focused on the correlates between trauma and multiple sclerosis (in additional to other disabilities) and its psychological effects. The *diff* command be used to compare the survey results of two different patients interviewed. It would allow me or other researchers to assess the fundamental differences in their demographics and experiences that could be detected through coding. From here, it would allow me to efficiently carry out the process of looking through the actual qualitiative results and findings. Using this quantitative analysis would streamline the subsequent qualitative process of understanding psychological trauma and its effects.\n",
